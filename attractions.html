             <h3>Waikite Valley Thermal Pooks</h3>
             <p>Geothermal experience and hot pool bathing in pure natural geothermal waters overlooking Waikite Valley, native bush and surrounding geothermal activity.

                Waikite Valley Thermal Pools is a unique place to come and experience the ‘Living Waters’ of the Te Manaroa Spring, the largest single source of pure boiling geothermal water in New Zealand.  
                
                Take a stroll along the informative geothermal Eco-Trail. Of geological and botanical interest, this educational walk leads to the violently magnificent Te Manaroa Spring. Watch in awe as the spring discharges thousands of litres of geothermal energy into the Otamakokore Stream that winds its way downstream leaving a trail of calcite formations in its wake.
                
                Enjoy nature's ambience in one of our four private spas (must be pre-booked). Control the temperature of your individual private pool, which looks out over Waikite Valley, native bush and surrounding geothermal activity.
