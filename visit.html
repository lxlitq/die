    <h1>VISA REQUIREMENTS</h1>
    <br>
    <p>If you plan to visit New Zealand for a short period, you need to request a New Zealand Electronic Travel
        Authority (NZeTA) before you travel if you are:
        - A citizen of a country which has a visa waiver agreement with New Zealand (you can stay up to three months)



        If you don’t meet the above, then you’ll need a visitor visa. The fastest and easiest way to apply for a visitor
        visa is online.


        Before travelling to New Zealand, you need to make sure your passport is valid for at least three months longer
        than your expected departure date.

        Be sure to request your NZeTA, or apply for your visitor visa well in advance of travel to avoid delays.

        If you have a biometric ordinary passport (or electronic passport) and are over 12 years old, you may be able to
        use New Zealand Customs eGate service. This allows you to complete your Customs and Immigration checks faster so
        you can get on with enjoying your visit to New Zealand.
