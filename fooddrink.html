                place to meet. Live music every Friday night helps clear the work week's cobwebs, and chilled-out Sunday
                Sessions from 1pm create a smooth vibe to round out the weekend.

                the daily specials that change each day.

                With a large indoor-to-outdoor flow, Ambrosia is perfect for functions, such as celebrating birthdays,
                anniversaries, work functions or weddings, and can seat 110 comfortably inside.
